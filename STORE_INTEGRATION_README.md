# ðŸš€ Store Owner & Customer Interface Integration

## Overview
This implementation creates a **real-time connection** between the Store Owner's product management interface and the Customer's store browsing interface. When store owners update products, customers see the changes instantly!

## ðŸ”— How It Works

### 1. **Shared Data Context (`ProductsContext`)**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All product and store data is managed in one place
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes propagate instantly across all interfaces
- **Data Consistency**: No more duplicate or conflicting data

### 2. **Store Owner Interface (`src/screens/storeOwner/Products.tsx`)**
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, duplicate, delete products
- **Status Control**: Toggle products between Active/Inactive
- **Stock Management**: Monitor inventory levels
- **Real-time Stats**: Live product statistics and revenue tracking

### 3. **Customer Interface (`src/screens/customer/StoreBrowse.tsx` & `src/screens/customer/CustomerHome.tsx`)**
- **Live Product Display**: Shows only Active products with stock > 0
- **Instant Updates**: Product changes appear immediately
- **Smart Filtering**: Search and category filtering using live data
- **Store Navigation**: Browse stores with real-time product availability

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### **Real-time Synchronization**
- âœ… **Add Product**: New products appear instantly in customer interface
- âœ… **Edit Product**: Price, name, description changes update immediately
- âœ… **Toggle Status**: Active/Inactive products show/hide in real-time
- âœ… **Delete Product**: Removed products disappear from customer view
- âœ… **Stock Updates**: Out-of-stock products automatically hidden from customers

### **Smart Data Filtering**
- **Customer View**: Only sees Active products with stock > 0
- **Store Owner View**: Sees all products (Active + Inactive)
- **Category Filtering**: Real-time category-based product filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Live search across product names, SKUs, and categories

### **Store Management**
- **Multi-store Support**: Each store owner can manage multiple stores
- **Store-specific Products**: Products are linked to specific stores
- **Customer Store Browsing**: Customers can browse different stores independently

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Context Structure**
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  storeId: string;        // Links product to specific store
  name: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  stock: number;
  status: 'Active' | 'Inactive';  // Controls customer visibility
  featured: boolean;
  // ... other properties
}

interface Store {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  ownerId: string;        // Links store to specific owner
  categories: string[];
  // ... other properties
}
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Store Owner** makes changes in Products interface
2. **ProductsContext** updates the shared state
3. **Customer interfaces** automatically re-render with new data
4. **Real-time sync** achieved through React's state management

### **Key Functions**
```typescript
// Store Owner Functions
addProduct(product: Product)           // Add new product
updateProduct(id, updates)            // Edit existing product
deleteProduct(id)                     // Remove product
getStoreOwnerProducts(ownerId)        // Get owner's products

// Customer Functions
getCustomerStoreProducts(storeId)     // Get visible products for store
searchProducts(query, storeId?)       // Search products
getProductsByCategory(category, storeId?) // Filter by category
```

3. **Result**: Product shows/hides in customer interface based on status

### **Step 3: Delete a Product**
1. In Store Owner â†’ Products, find any product
2. Click "Delete" button
3. **Result**: Product disappears from customer interface immediately

### **Step 4: View Customer Interface**
